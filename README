MyEnv
=====

MyEnv is a tool to operate MySQL and MariaDB multi-instance set-ups.

With MyEnv multi-instance set-ups should be easier to handle than with
mysqld_multi. This type of consolidation has less overhad than virtualization
solutions. To do proper resource fencing MyEnv provides cgroup integration.
