MyEnv
=====

MyEnv is a tool to operate several MySQL and MariaDB instances on one host. We
call this multi-instance set-ups.

With MyEnv a multi-instance set-up is more comfortable to handle than with
mysqld_multi (old) or systemd services (new).
Using MyEnv does not need the use of the root user to operate MySQL and MariaDB
databases. Thus it is appropriate for classical enterprise DBA organizations.
Further multi-instance set-ups is a much more efficient way of consolidating
MySQL and MariaDB databases an has less overhead than virtualization solutions.
To do proper resource fencing MyEnv provides cgroup integration (container
integration is planned for the future).
