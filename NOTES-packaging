RPM packages of "myenv"
=======================

Platforms supported by RPM packages
-----------------------------------

Myenv is a PHP application which does not bring any binaries, so the RPMs
are "noarch" RPMs which would in theory fit any platform.

In practice, there are platform-specific differences which make the RPMs
platform-specific:
1) The code uses some PHP features, so the RPMs have "Requires:" dependencies
   on the PHP packages providing these features. Those package names differ
   between the distributions, so the RPMs differ in their dependencies.
2) Myenv is meant to run as a service, so that the user/DBA may configure
   MySQL instances for autostart via myenv. This requires different files
   depending on the startup mechanism used, SysV init or systemd.

Currently (July 2017), FromDual plans to provide myenv RPMs for
- RedHat / Oracle / CentOS / Scientific Linux 7, labeled "el7"
- RedHat / Oracle / CentOS / Scientific Linux 6, labeled "el6"
- SuSE Enterprise / OpenSuSE 12, labeled "suse12"
- SuSE Enterprise / OpenSuSE 11, labeled "suse11"
The spec file also supports Fedora, labeled "fc", but the demand for this
platform is so low that there is no decision yet whether packages will be
provided.

Building the RPMs
-----------------

As the packages do not contain any binaries, and all dependencies are
listed explicitly, there is no need to build the RPMs in an environment
that is (or simulates) the target platform.

While the spec file will analyze the build platform and set it as the
target platform by default, this can be overridden: A call

    rpmbuild --define="distro_releasetag STRING" PATH/TO/myenv.spec

will bypass the platform analysis and set the target platform from STRING.
STRING must be one of the labels listed above, or else the build will abort.
To support further target platforms, they must be added to the platform:
- The "%if" cascade checking "%{distro_releasetag}" must be extended.
- Auto-recognition via "/etc/DISTRO-release" should be added.

Build platform
--------------

As RPM details tend to change over time, the build platform should best
be an old one, so that the packages do not use newer features than 
available on the installation machine.
In practice, RPMs built on Fedora 23 could be installed on CentOS 6.5
and 7 and also on openSuSE 13 without issues.
The RPM format is correct for SLES 12 (but PHP was unavailable for tests).
They produced warnings on SLES 11 about "rpmlib(FileDigests)",
but installation succeeded using the option "--nodeps".

Installation
------------

Myenv is intended to be run by user "mysql", because it is meant to run
one or more MySQL (generic, includes MariaDB and Percona) instances,
and "mysql" is by convention the user running the MySQL server.

To support this, the myenv RPMs create both the user and the group "mysql".
If the group already exists, it will be used.
If the user "mysql" already exists, the installation scriptlet will check
the user's login shell and home directory.

If the login shell is not set or is"/bin/false" or "/usr/sbin/nologin",
it will be changed to "/bin/bash". Other settings will not be changed.
If it is any other program, chances are myenv will not work.

If the home directory is anything other than "/home/mysql", the installation
scriptlet will try to change it to that value. Changing the home directory
is impossible if any process is running for user "mysql". The scriptlet
will recognize that and fail during pre-installation, so the RPM cannot
be installed. It is left to the user to stop that process and then repeat
the installation.


DEB packages of "myenv"
=======================

Platforms supported by DEB packages
-----------------------------------

Myenv is a PHP application which does not bring any binaries, so the DEBs
are "independent" DEBs which fit any platform: Debian and Ubuntu.

Because Ubuntu follows Debian, the dependencies have the same package names.

The different startup mechanisms of older (SysV) and newer distributions
(systemd) can be handled by the maintainer scripts.
This way, the packages have no dependencies on the startup mechanism packages
and check the current situation at (de)installation time.

Currently (July 2017), FromDual plan expects the myenv DEBs to work on
- Debian 7, 8, and 9 = wheezy, jessie, and stretch
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS = trusty and xenial
and the intermediate Ubuntu releases (not tested).

Building the DEBs
-----------------

As the packages do not contain any binaries, there is no need to build the
DEBs in a specific environment.

Until signature keys are introduced, these build commands are used:

    tar xzf myenv-VERSION.tar.gz
    cd myenv-VERSION
    dpkg-buildpackage -S -uc -us   # the source package
    dpkg-buildpackage -A -uc -us   # the "binary" package

Typically, a DEB build takes "debhelper" scripts from the build environment
and inserts them into the maintainer scripts {pre,post}{inst,rm}.
As this would make the package contents depend on the build environment,
it includes the risk that the maintainer scripts may fail in the installation
environment. To protect against that risk, the (unified) "debhelper" scripts
of Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 have been inserted verbatim into the maintainer
scripts.
When newer distributions introduce new requirements, these snippets may
need adjustment.
