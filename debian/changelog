myenv (1.3.1.899-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * First release for which Debian/Ubuntu packages are built.
    Packages should cover _all_ Debian + Ubuntu versions:
    wheezy = Debian 7
    jessie = Debian 8
    stretch = Debian 9
    trusty = Ubuntu 14.04
    xenial = Ubuntu 16.04

  * Maintainer scripts are still "under construction",
    and the startup files (SysV vs systemd) are still missing.
